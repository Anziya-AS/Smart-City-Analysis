# 🌆 Smart City Analysis

A data-driven analysis project focusing on improving urban living conditions by studying traffic patterns, accident zones, and air pollution levels across a smart city framework.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To analyze and visualize datasets related to:
- 🚗 Traffic congestion patterns
- ⚠️ Road accidents and high-risk zones
- 🌫️ Air pollution concentration levels

The goal is to extract insights that can guide smart city planning, improve citizen safety, and optimize city resources.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Power BI** – for dashboards and KPI visualizations
- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn)** – for data cleaning and charting
- **Excel** – for initial data merging and filtering

---

## 📊 Data Sources

- Traffic flow reports from city surveillance
- Accident logs by date/location/severity
- Pollution data (PM2.5, NO2, CO2) by region and time

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- 🚦 Identified peak traffic hours and bottlenecks
- ⚠️ Mapped high-accident zones near intersections and poor visibility areas
- 🌫️ Found correlation between traffic and localized air pollution spikes
